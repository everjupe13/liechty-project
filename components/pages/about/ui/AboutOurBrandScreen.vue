              Our brand is a new stage in the development of Buhler-AHS brand,
              which has demonstrated with year after year that it has grown from
              a subsidiary of a well-known agricultural holding company to
              become a leader in premium climate equipment.

              At the end of 2022, the board of directors of Buhler Industries
              (the parent company) decided to rebrand Buhler-AHS to, among other
              things, remove any association and connection with agricultural
              machinery.

              At the helm of Buhler-AHS and now the rebranded Liechty brand
              remains John Buhler - true legend, who has not only succeeded in
              creating a company in a completely new field, but also in making
              it known far beyond Canada's borders.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-18 leading-snug text-16 md:mb-14 md:text-14">
              John Buhler assembled a team of European engineers, opening a
              development office in Liechtenstein. The headquarters and front
              office of the new brand remains in Canada.
