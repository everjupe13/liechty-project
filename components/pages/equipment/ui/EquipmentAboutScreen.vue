            All Liechty systems share a common commitment to achieving optimal
            water filtration before atomizing it into residential, commercial,
            or industrial premises. Each model of the central modules features a
            double reverse osmosis system, a tank for volumetric UV
            sterilization, and a high-pressure hoseline for washing with
            re-sterilization. This multi-stage purification process results in
            water that is 99.5% free of salts, effectively eliminating the risk
            of white scale formation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Liechty modules are equipped with unique pumps that operate
            silently, ensuring high performance and a long lifespan.
            <br />
            <br />
            High-precision humidity sensors monitor the RH level in the rooms
            and relay this information to the central module and nozzles, thus
            allowing for humidification with a strong emphasis on maintaining
            high hygiene and user safety.

            The Classic Line series offers nozzle humidification systems with
            unique solutions for your home, apartment, or office.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this system, water is first purified by a unique multi-stage
            purification system and then atomized by miniature nozzles directly
            into the premises, instantly increasing the RH level and providing
            freshness. The Liechty system can be controlled using standard
            control units, which can be either wired or wireless and feature
            built-in high-accuracy humidity sensors.
            <br />
            <br />
            Depending on the model, the system can be either dual-zone (CL
            Playgreen) or multi-zone (CL Manitoba).
