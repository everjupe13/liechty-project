            All Liechty systems are united by the concept of perfect filtration
            of water before it is atomized into residential, commercial or
            industrial premises. All models of the central modules are equipped
            with double reverse osmosis system and a tank for volumetric UV
            sterilization, as well as high-pressure hoseline washing with
            re-sterilization. Water after multi-stage purification is 99.5% free
            of salts, so the risk of white scale formation is eliminated.
