    <h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>A. Information about You that You Provide.</strong>
      Liechty, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect
      information you provide directly to Liechty and/or its Service Providers
      via the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services
      (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information that Liechty, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party
      Services may collect from you includes: your first and last name,
      institution/company, e-mail address, user name, social media logins and
      other credentials, phone number, address, payment information and other
      information that personally identifies you (
      <strong>“Personally Identifiable Information”</strong>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>B. Information Collected Automatically.</strong>
      Liechty, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also
      automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use
      the Service (
      <strong>“Usage Information”</strong>
      ). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser
      type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and
      data regarding network-connected hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Log Information:</strong>
        Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP
        address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,
        operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored
        in log files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong>
        Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded
        scripts, location-identifying technologies, device recognition
        technologies, in-app tracking methods, device and activity monitoring
        and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (
        <strong>“Tracking Technologies”</strong>
        ) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service
        or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing
        behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some information about your use of the Service and certain other online
      services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and
      services and used by Liechty and third parties for purposes such as to
      associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and/or other
      content to you on the Service and certain other online services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>C. Limitations.</strong>
      To the extent any non-PII, or PII collected outside of the Service or by
      Third-Party Services, is combined by or on behalf of Liechty with
      Personally Identifiable Information Liechty itself collects directly from
      you on the Service (
      <strong>Liechty-Collected PII”</strong>
      ), we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, unless required
      by applicable law, this Privacy Policy is not intended to limit Liechty
      activities regarding information that does not personally identify you
      such that it does not constitute PII, including PII that has been
      “De-identified” (i.e., the removal or modification of the personally
      identifiable elements, or the extraction of non-personally identifiable
      elements), and non-Liechty-Collected PII (including third-party-sourced,
      or non-Service-sourced, information) that is not combined with
      Liechty-Collected PII.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of “personal information” under certain California laws
      differs from the definition of PII used in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN.</h3>
    <p>
      Liechty may use information about you for any purposes not inconsistent
      with Liechty's statements under this Privacy Policy, or otherwise made by
      us in writing at the point of collection, and not prohibited by applicable

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>3. INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES.</h3>
    <p>
      Generally, Liechty may share information about you for any purposes not
      inconsistent with Liechty's statements under this Privacy Policy, or
      otherwise made by us in writing at the point of collection, and not
      prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation, the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        with our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers
        (collectively
        <strong>“Service Providers”</strong>
        ) in connection with their work on our behalf, including assisting in
        the provision of the Service;
      </li>
      <li>
        if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our terms of use or
        other applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property,
        life, health, security and safety of Liechty, the Service, or its users,
        or any third party;
      </li>
      <li>
        to comply with law, law enforcement or other legal process, and, where
        permitted, in response to governmental requests or legal process (for
        example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); and
      </li>
      <li>
        to other circumstances in which we have a good faith belief that a crime
        has been or is being committed by a user.
        <br />
        In addition, we may share information about you as follows:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <u>Marketing:</u>
      We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you marketing
      communications. Absent your consent (which may be by means of opt-in, your
      election not to opt-out, or a third party interaction described in the
      next bullet point), however, Liechty will not share your Liechty-Collected
      PII with third parties, other than Liechty Affiliates, for their own
      direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate
      Transactions (defined below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>With Your Disclosure or Consent:</u>
      (Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising
      and Analytics), your activities on the Service may, by their nature,
      result in the sharing of your information with third parties and by
      engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and
      disclosure to third parties. Such third-party data receipt and collection
      is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not
      Liechty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Corporate Transactions:</u>
      In addition, Liechty may share information about you in connection with or
      during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business,
      or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition
      or business combination of all or any portion of Liechty assets, or
      transfer of all or a portion of Liechty's business to another company,
      whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
      similar proceeding (
      <strong>“Corporate Transactions”</strong>
      ).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3><strong>4. SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS.</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Liechty may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a
      <strong>“Promotion”</strong>
      ), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties,
      which may require submitting Personally Identifiable Information. If you
      voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including
      Personally Identifiable Information, may be disclosed to Liechty,
      co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for
      administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).
      By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that
      Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data
      practices from those contained in this Privacy Policy. Please review those
      rules carefully.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>5. INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS.</h3>
    <p>
      The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without
      limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings,
      computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personally
      Identifiable Information. If you choose to submit UGC to any public area
      of the Service, your UGC will be considered “public” and will be
      accessible by anyone, including Liechty. Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary, unless otherwise explicitly agreed by us, Personally
      Identifiable Information included in UGC is not subject to Liechty’s usage
      or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding Liechty-Collected
      PII or other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Policy
      or otherwise, and may be used and shared by Liechty and third parties to
      the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. Liechty encourages
      you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in
      such public areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication
      to a friend or other contact. If so, Liechty relies on you to only send to
      people that have given you permission to do so. The recipient’s Personally
      Identifiable Information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be
      used to facilitate the communication, but not used by Liechty for any
      other marketing purpose unless Liechty obtains consent from that person.
      Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>
      6. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING
      AND ANALYTICS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Service may include or link to third-party websites, apps, locations,
      platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces (
      <strong>“API”</strong>
      ), and software development kits (
      <strong>“SDKs”</strong>
      )) or other services (
      <strong>“Third-Party Service(s)”</strong>
      ). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and
      other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you
      and may solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you
      initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as
      third party social networks (
      <strong>“Social Features”</strong>
      ). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such
      as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service;
      “liking” or “sharing” Liechty’s content; logging in to the Service using
      your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in
      to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party
      Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). If you
      use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services,
      information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the
      Service or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post
      information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (e.g., by
      using a hashtag associated with Liechty or other Liechty Affiliates in a
      tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with
      the Service or otherwise by Liechty and Liechty Affiliates. Also, both
      Liechty and the third party may have access to certain information about
      you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liechty may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties
      to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on other online services.
      Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing
      of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of
      precise location and/or Cross-device Data, sometimes referred to as
      “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (
      <strong>“Interest-based Advertising”</strong>
      ), which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you
      have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Liechty is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding,
      the policies or business practices of any third parties, including,
      without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services
      associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself
      with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>7. DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING.</h3>
    <p>
      Liechty takes reasonable measures to protect your information (excluding
      public UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet
      and online digital storage are not completely secure and Liechty does not
      guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER.</h3>
    <p>
      Liechty is based in the U.S. and the information Liechty and its Service
      Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the
      Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information
      collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored,
      and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different
      from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or
      provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the
      transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your
      information, including Personally Identifiable Information, in the U.S. as
      set forth in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY.</h3>
    <p>
      The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to
      children less than 13 years of age. Liechty does not intend to collect
      personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy
      Protection Act (
      <strong>“COPPA”</strong>
      ) (
      <strong>“Children’s Personal Information”</strong>
      ) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If we obtain knowledge that
      we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not
      permitted by COPPA, we will remove such data to the extent required by
      COPPA.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>10. ACCESSING AND CHANGING INFORMATION.</h3>
    <p>
      To the extent required by applicable law, Liechty may provide web pages or
      other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the
      information that we have collected and retained, and potentially certain
      other information about you (e.g., profile and account information).
      Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable
      law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes
      for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by
      applicable law.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>11. CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>A. Tracking Technologies Generally.</strong>
      Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as
      part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the
      future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different
      functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately. Also,
      tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to certain
      Tracking Technologies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these
      technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you
      revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking
      Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser
      usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by
      uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from
      your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile
      device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking,
      but these may not be completely effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not
      Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no
      consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in
      this context. Like many online services, Liechty currently does not alter
      Liechty practices when Liechty receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a
      visitor’s browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not represent that these third-party tools, programs or statements
      are complete or accurate. You will need to do this on each browser that
      you use to access our Services, and clearing cookies on your browser(s)
      may disable your preference settings. Also, our Services may not function
      properly or as intended if you block all or even certain cookies.
      Accordingly, you may want to consider the more limited opt-out choices
      noted in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>B. Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.</strong>
      You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google
      Analytics by going to
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">
        https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
      </a>
      or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may
      exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by
      going to
      <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank">
        https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html

      under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of
      their web sites or tailor their online ads for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by
      submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that
      perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may
      participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (
      <strong>“DAA”</strong>
      ) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more
      about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based
      Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit

      <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank">
        http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
      </a>
      for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps
      (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these
      companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (
      <strong>“NAI”</strong>
      ). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members,
      see
      <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/
      </a>
      . Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds
      of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of
      ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer
      deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you
      will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other
      ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
      you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
      use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of
      access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not,
      or may no longer, be effective. Liechty supports the ad industry’s

      Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though Liechty cannot
      guaranty their compliance.

      third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their
      statements regarding their programs.

    <p>
      <strong>C. Mobile Apps.</strong>
      With respect to Liechty mobile apps (
      <strong>“apps”</strong>
      ), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by
      uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy
      choices, such as enabling or disabling certain features (e.g., tracking
      across apps and websites owned by other online services, location-based
      services, push notifications, accessing calendar/contacts/photos, etc.),
      by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device and/or the app’s
      settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>D. Communications.</strong>
      You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications from
      Liechty at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the
      instructions provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if
      available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your
      account; (ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in
      text messages from Liechty to text the word, “STOP”; and (iii) for app
