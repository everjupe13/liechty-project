    body: 'Adiabatic humidification involves adding humidity to the air in liquid form and then converting it to a gaseous state. This requires energy, which is extracted from the surrounding air. This process also results in the temperature decrease and is therefore known as adiabatic cooling.'

      <ul>
        <li>unique purification formula (preliminary filtration + double RO)</li>  
        <li>volumetric UV sterilization with circulation & re-sterilization</li>  
        <li>noiseless operation</li>  
        <li>uservice at POU</li>  
        <li>adiabatic cooling & dust suppression</li>

    label: 'How does your system operate?',
    body: `<p>First of all, inlet water is purified by unique multi-stage purification system. Secondly it is pressurized by silent HP pump to the hoseline.<p>
      <p>Finally, it is atomized by miniature nozzles directly into premises, instantly incresing RH level and providing freshness.</p> 
      <p>The systems is controlled by control units (either wired or wireless) with built-in humidity sensors of high accuracy.</p> `
